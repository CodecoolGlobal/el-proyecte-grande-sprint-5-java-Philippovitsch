## Project description <em>(by Codecool)</em>

> As your Codecool Journey comes closer to its conclusion, the time has come for a final Teamwork Project that will put
> to test all of the programming skills you've obtained so far (and some new ones you will learn on the way)!
>
> You have the freedom of choosing your teammates (assemble a team of 3-4 students) and the project's topic this time.
> Think of an app that you would find useful in your daily activities, a tool that an employee of a certain industry might
> crave, a fun game or something completely out of the box.
>
> This project is meant for 4 sprints at least, but it may keep you company until the end of the course, or even much
> longer. Who knows? Although we will not give you any direct tasks to fulfill, there will be some technical requirements
> for each sprint. You are expected to make incremental changes in a Scrum way, developing the project further and further,
> adding new features, technologies, etc.
>
> <b>Â¡Comience El Proyecte Grande!</b>
